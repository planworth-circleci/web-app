## Code Formatting

- following [AirBnB styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- linting is built into react-scripts (CRA config source)[https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js]
- use prettier to automatically format code

## Styles

We are using a hybrid approach to styling. The preferred system is CSS modules for its simplicity and statically compiled performance. However MUI forces us to use their style and theming system.

- use MUI css-in-js styling for theme and theme dependent styling
- use CSS modules for components that are independent and reusable. Can support using css variable overrides to customize it.
- share variables using css variables
- using some global styles for reset css and libraries like animate.css

## Documentation
